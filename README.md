# Intuit Build Challenge

This repository contains my submission for the **Intuit Build Challenge**, consisting of two independent tasks implemented in Python.


---




## Task 1 – Library Management System

A simple object-oriented library system that supports:

- Adding books and registering members
- Checking out and returning books
- Enforcing borrowing limits and fine rules
- Calculating overdue fines
- Tracking borrowing history
- Unit testing core functionality

 **Details:** See `Task1/README.md` for full documentation, assumptions, and usage instructions.

---

## Task 2 – Order Invoice Summary

A file-processing application that:

- Parses pipe-delimited order records from a text file
- Applies business rules and discounts
- Aggregates data by customer
- Generates a formatted invoice summary report
- Logs malformed or invalid records
- Includes unit tests for validation and edge cases

**Details:** See `Task2/README.md` for full documentation, assumptions, and usage instructions.

## Setup

Each task is self-contained and includes its own `requirements.txt`.

To run a task:
1. Navigate to the task directory
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the program or tests as described in the task README

---

## Testing

Both tasks use **pytest** for unit testing.

Tests are designed to:
- Cover core functionality
- Validate business rules
- Handle edge cases and invalid inputs
- Ensure deterministic behavior

---

## Notes


- All design assumptions are explicitly documented in the respective task README files

Thank you for reviewing my submission.
